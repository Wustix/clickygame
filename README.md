# Clickgame

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

# Technologies Utilized

* Html
* CSS/BootStrap
* React.js
* Node.js
* JSX/JavaScrip

# Overview

The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once or if they reach the highest possible score of 12. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
